# Wave simulation with FDM and PCG
Simulation of waves using [Finite Difference Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) (FDM) and [Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method) (PCG) method as a solver of linear systems.

Project was implemented as a part of [Scientific Computing](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2013/scicomp/fall) course in University of Tartu. Complete overview of the project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/MTAT.08.010/2013_fall/uploads/Main/project1.pdf). As a result, series of pictures representing wave simulation are created (should be manually combined to gif file).
